1981 Datsun by Nissan 280ZX, 2 + 2, with t-tops, and 5 speed. Car runs and drives as it just had a fresh tune up. I have a clear and clean title. The car does have few rust/cancer spots, but mostly has a straight body. Has Kenwood AM/FM, CD, and Sirus Satalite radio installed. Power windows, and mirros, K&N Cold Air intake, oversize throttle body, tuned header, aftermarket exhaust, brute force clutch, 16" Centerline wheels, and A/C compressor works but needs to be converted from R12 to 134.
